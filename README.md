## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br>

My name is Jean-Baptiste ! 
I've been interested about AI for the last 3 years. I've been able to learn more thanks to **the bootcamp datascience** that [the Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr) suggest and for which I've been awarded a diploma ðŸ˜Š. During this bootcamp, I had the opportunity to do a CNN project in a group, which was very interesting. 
For more info ðŸ‘‰ [Deep Draw Project](https://github.com/Jbguerin13/Deep-Draw-Project)

<br>

Since then, I've been continuing my development training by the Python Application Developer course suggested by [Openclassroom School](https://openclassrooms.com/fr). I've got 1 year of training left and 4 final projects to complete ðŸš€!

<br>

At the same time I'm working for [Jellyfish](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-gb/) as a software engineer. It's also where I'm learning to do my job with all the rigour and methods needed to write readable and easily maintainable code.

<br>

ðŸŒ± Also Iâ€™m currently learning during my Openclassroom projects where I'll start soon an API with Django framework !
ðŸ”­ Furthermore Iâ€™m currently working on pagination method with FastAPI on a project at Jellyfish.
